The majority of more than 200,000 conservation areas around the world include human habitation within their boundaries or surrounding areas, and it has been estimated that over a billion people depend on these conservation areas for a significant percentage of their livelihoods. Many studies have also shown that conservation areas work best if they are supported by local people, such as indigenous and local communities. Hence it is critical to involve local people in the governance and management of these areas to effectively meet their dual objectives of conservation and development. However, most global reference datasets and information systems on conservation areas do not even include basic information on the people living in and around these areas, thus hindering their consideration in high-level decisions on protected area policy, management and funding.

We are making use of a new global dataset on human settlements to provide a series of indicators that show, for each conservation area and its associated buffer zone, the a) proportion of built-up area, b) estimated population (number of inhabitants) and c) estimated population density (number of inhabitants per square kilometre). These indicators can be easily combined with other information such as the governance type and management category of conservation areas to identify potential sources of conflict: for example, where strictly protected areas overlap with the presence and interests of local communities, or where government-run protected areas do not involve local people living in and around them. We will use examples of natural World Heritage sites and other protected areas in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries to discuss our findings and their implications.

The new indicators will be freely available from the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA), a web based information system developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, to help decision makers better understand the importance of involving local people in the planning, establishment, management and governance of the worldâ€™s conservation areas. This information will also be useful for donors of conservation and development aid, including the European Commission, and the recipients of this aid (e.g. governments and non-government organisations) to ensure their programmes and projects better consider and involve local communities.
