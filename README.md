DOPA EXPLORER 3
===============
Welcome to DOPA Explorer GIT repository, the Joint Research Centreâ€™s web based information system on the world's protected areas, which helps the European Commission and other users to assess the state of and the pressure on protected areas at multiple scales.

Using global reference datasets, the DOPA supports monitoring and reporting through a broad range of consistent and comparable indicators at country, ecoregion and protected area level. These indicators are particularly relevant for Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (Protected Areas) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 14 (Life below Water) and 15 (Life on Land).
